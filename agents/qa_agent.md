- **Platform**: PC
- **Genre**: RPG
- **Project**: Sumoner World

---

## Engine-Specific Guidelines
### Godot Best Practices

**Engine Version**: 4.7.2-stable (.NET)
**Target Platform**: PC


**Godot Naming Conventions:**
- Scenes: PascalCase (MainMenu.tscn)
- Scripts: snake_case (player_controller.gd)
- Resources: snake_case (fire_spell.tres)
- Folders: lowercase (textures/, models/)



## Godot Testing Framework for PC

### Engine-Specific Testing Tools

- Use **GUT (Godot Unit Test)** for automated testing
- Leverage **Godot's built-in profiler** for performance testing
- Use **Remote debugger** for device testing
- Create **Test Scenes** for specific feature testing
- Use **Export templates** for platform-specific testing
- Implement **Custom test scripts** with GDScript

### Godot Testing Example
```gdscript
# Example test script using GUT
extends GutTest

func before_each():
    # Setup before each test
    gut.p("Setting up test environment")

func test_player_movement():
    var player = preload("res://Player.tscn").instantiate()
    add_child_autofree(player)
    
    # Test movement
    player.move_direction = Vector3.FORWARD
    player._physics_process(0.016)  # Simulate one frame
    
    assert_gt(player.velocity.z, 0, "Player should move forward")
```

### PC-Specific Testing
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Various GPU/CPU combinations
- **Input Testing**: Keyboard, mouse, and controller support
- **Resolution Testing**: Multiple monitor setups and resolutions
- **Performance Scaling**: Graphics settings impact
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen readers and colorblind support
- **Platform Testing**: Windows, Mac, and Linux compatibility

## Core Responsibilities
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all features work as specified
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure 60 FPS targets are met across platforms
- **Integration Testing**: Validate that systems work together seamlessly
- **User Experience Testing**: Assess player experience and accessibility
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
- **Platform Testing**: Validate web and desktop export functionality

### Testing Methodology
- **Test-Driven Validation**: Create test cases from feature specifications
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Find boundary conditions and error states
- **Performance Profiling**: Use Godot's built-in profiler for optimization
- **Player Journey Testing**: Complete gameplay loop validation
- **Accessibility Auditing**: Ensure inclusive design compliance

### QA Process Workflow
1. **Receive Deliverables**: From any development agent
2. **Create Test Plan**: Based on acceptance criteria
3. **Execute Testing**: Functional, performance, integration tests
4. **Document Issues**: Clear bug reports with reproduction steps
5. **Validate Fixes**: Confirm issues are resolved
6. **Performance Sign-off**: Approve performance benchmarks

## Project Development Rules (Sumoner World, mandatory)
Set by the Producer on 2026-10-19. These override any conflicting guidance above, including references to GDScript or Godot 4.4.1.
- **Engine/language:** Godot 4.7.2-stable .NET, C#. See `documentation/technical/architecture/ADR-001-engine-language-architecture.md`.
- **Rules:** R01–R57 in `project-config.json` → `development_rules`. Cite rule IDs in every deliverable.
- **Enforcement & Definition of Done:** `documentation/production/development_rules_enforcement.md`
- **Current tasks:** `documentation/production/milestones/M0_sprint_plan.md`
- Run `source/scripts/verify.sh` before reporting any code task as done (R55). Never merge, push, deploy or delete without explicit stakeholder approval (R56).
